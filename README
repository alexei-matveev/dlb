The library created in this subfolder (called libdlb.a) takes care about
dynamical load balancing.  There are two different cases possible: one where
all jobs are equal in name and a second one where each job has a special
colour.  There are 6 different functions alltogether, where two are commmon
ones, while of the other each two belong to the case with and without color.


DIFFERENT VARIANTS

Which of the different variants of the DLB implementions is used is selected by
DLB_VARIANT. In the case of DLB_VARIANT = 0 there is a static distribution,
where no communication between the processors is used.

DLB_VARIANT = 1: is a remote memory access (RMA) method. When RMA is really
    asynchornous, or done by the hardware, this method can be uses.

DLB_VARIANT = 2 and DLB_VARIANT = 3: Both methods use threads for making the
    DLB algorithm work. They need a higher level of thread safety than the
    normal MPI_INIT. They should be run with MPI_INIT_THREAD, where the variant
    2 needs at least level MPI_THREAD_SERIALIZED, while variant 3 needs
    MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE. The start some threads to handle the MPI_communication
    between the processors. Variant 3 needs a good thread handling for
    blocking MPI calls. If this thread alternates nicely with the working thread
    this method should be better than variant 2, where this alternation is
    done by hand. But MPI has often an aggressive polling by blocking calls,
    where the variant 3 easily doubles the time requirement.
    The variants need also POSIX Threads available.

ACTING OF DLB:

DLB takes care about the available job numbers. On request it gives several of
this to a processor to work on. It takes care that each of them is given back
exactly once.  If a processor runs out of jobs, he can, for DLB_VARIANT > 0,
ask the other processors to give them some of theirs.

INTERFACE

All functions have to be called on all processors.  The two common functions
are: dlb_init and dlb_finalize. They have to surround the use of the other
functions.  When calling dlb_init MPI has to be already initalized, also dlb
finalize has to be called before MPI_FINALIZE. Other than the MPI counterparts
there is the possibility to finalize and initalize dlb in between some uses.
Both functions have no arguments, thus use them by:

    call dlb_init()
    ...
    call dlb_finalize()

The calculation itself is done by the thow functions dlb_setup and
dlb_give_more (or their counterpart with colors dlb_setup_color and
dlb_give_more_color)

dlb_setup will take the number of available jobs as an argument. It will
already perform a statical distribution.

dlb_give_more has two arguments: the first MAXJOBS stands for the number of job
numbers it wants at once. The second argument is the interval jobs, which the
processor should now work on. The work the processor should then do is between
jobs(1) + 1 and jobs(2). dlb_give_more is a function, which will return true as
long as there a jobs and false if there are none. In the last case there will
be also jobs(1) >= jobs(2). If it returns true there is always at least one
job.  But there may be also fewer, if the proccessor has only few, this has
nothing to do with the amount of jobs, all processors have.  If it returns
false, all processors have terminated (except in case DLB_VARIANT = 0).
Otherwise it will wait in the function dlb_give_more if the termination has not
yet confirmed.

Usage:

    call dlb_setup(NJOBS) ! NJOBS is integer

while dlb_give_more(MAXJOBS, jobs) ! MAXJOBS is integer, jobs(2) is integer array

The difference of the color case, is that here the color is also considered.
In dlb_setup_color one gives a distribution, with the colors, thus it gets an
integer array containing elements like (/startnumber, endnumber, color/).
Where startnumber +1 to endnumber a the jobsnumber on element color.
dlb_give_more_color will give in adition to the jobs their color. Furhermore it
ensures that all jobs it gives back have the same color.

Usage:

call dlb_setup_color(distr) ! distr is integer array of size (many_colors, 3)
while dlb_give_more_color(MAXJOBS, color, jobs) ! MAXJOBS and color are integers, jobs(2)
is integer array

DLB AND THREAD SAFETY:

different implementations have different requirements concerning thread safety, especially
as some of the implementations build explicitely on them. MPI provides some different
MPI_THREAD_LEVELS, which show what could be expected in that regard from the current implementation.
Each dlb variant can show the required thread level, as it is stored in the variable
DLB_THREAD_REQUIRED, which is also handed over to the general dlb wrapper.
But be aware that the thread level is only for the usage of DLB. It is assumed that DLB will
be the only one to do some message passing in there. If the code, which uses DLB should have
also some thread level requirements one of course needs to use the higher one, which should
cause no problems to DLB. If in the parts of the code using DLB contain some message passing
also one even might to raise the level again. This of course does not affect MPI_THREAD_SINGLE
and might not even affect MPI_THREAD_FUNNELED  but MPI_THREAD_SERIALIZED should then be raised
to MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE.


EXAMPLE:

  use mpi
  use dlb
  integer :: ierr, prov, NJOBS, MAXJOBS, jobs(2), i
  integer :: distr(4,3), color

  call MPI_INIT_THREADS(MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE, prov, ierr)

  call dlb_init()

  NJOBS = 20
  MAXJOBS = 2

  call dlb_setup(NJOBS)
  do while( dlb_give_more(MAXJOBS, jobs) )
     do i = jobs(1) + 1, jobs(2)
        print *, "Doing job", i
     enddo
  enddo

  MAXJOBS = 3
  distr(1,:) = (/1, 0, 10)
  distr(2,:) = (/0, 9, 13)
  distr(3,:) = (/2, 0, 1)
  distr(4,:) = (/3, 3, 9)

  call dlb_setup_color(distr)
  do while( dlb_give_more_color(MAXJOBS, color, jobs) )
     do i = jobs(1) + 1, jobs(2)
        print *, "Doing job", i, "of color", color
     enddo
  enddo

  call dlb_finalize()

  call MPI_FINALIZE(ierr)

COMPILATION:

If DLB is used external from the ParaGauss repository set DLB_EXTERNAL = 1 on
top of the DLB Makefile.

OUTPUT LEVEL:

DLB is able to run without producing output. But it may also provide some informations
and statistics up to very detailed informations about its behaviour.
What it will print of them is selected by the output level. This may be changed by setting
the variable output_border in dlb_common.f90 to another value:
output_border = 0 : no output at all
output_border = 1 : at initalization it will be printed which DLB variant is used
output_border = 2 : the DLB variants  will also provide some more
                    statistics with summarized informations about the run of DLB
output_border > 2 : additional output will appear with time stamps at some selected places

As DLB is still in the testing phase output_border is set to 2 by default, which should allow
to understand better, where the problems are.
