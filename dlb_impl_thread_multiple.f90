module dlb_impl
  !---------------------------------------------------------------
  !
  !  Purpose: takes care about dynamical load balancing,
  !
  !           INTERFACE to others:
  !           call dlb_init() - once before first acces
  !           call dlb_setup(init_job) - once every time a dlb should
  !                               be used, init_job should be the part
  !                               of the current proc of an initial job
  !                               distribution
  !           dlb_give_more(n, jobs) :
  !              n should be the number of jobs requested at once, the next
  !              time dlb_give_more is called again, all jobs from jobs should
  !              be finished, jobs are at most n, they are jsut the number of the
  !              jobs, which still have to be transformed between each other,
  !              it should be done the error slice from jobs(0) +1 to jobs(1)
  !              if dlb_give_more returns jobs(0)==jobs(1) there are on no proc
  !              any jobs left
  !
  !          the algorithm: similar to dlb_module algorithm but with explicit mpi messages
  !                         they are sended and received by two seperate threads, thus the main
  !                         thread can work without noticing them on the jobs
  !                         Thread 2 (CONTROL) will be woke up if job_storage is empty
  !                         it sends a message to another proc, asking for more work, does so till it
  !                         got something or everything is terminated
  !                         Thread 3 (MAILBOX) checks all the time for messages, to which is responses
  !                         mostly by himself, but he informs (wakes up) CONTROL if he got more work
  !                         so that CONTROL takes care if another request has to be put and to deal
  !                         with the main thread
  !
  !          termination algorithm: called (at least once) "Fixed Energy Distributed Termination
  !                                 Algorithm"
  !                        to avoid confusion, here the term "energy" is not used, talking about
  !                         respoinsibility (resp) instead, every system starts with a part of responsibility
  !                         given to him, if procs steal from him, they have later to send him a
  !                         message saying how many of his jobs, they have done, they always report to
  !                         the proc who had the resp first, thus source is given away with job
  !                         each proc lowers his resp about the values given back from any proc and
  !                         about the jobs he has done himself, when finished them, if he has his resp
  !                         at zero, he sends a message to termination_master
  !                         if termination master has a message from all the procs, that their resp is 0
  !                         he sends a message to all procs, telling them to terminated the algorithm
  !
  !          THIS MAY BE IMPLEMENTED LATER, POSSIBLY IN A SEPARATE FILE:
  !          another possibility for the algorithm: with setting master_server = true another the algorithm is
  !                                                 is sliglty changed. In this case only one (the
  !                                                 termination_master) is  allowed to be asked for new jobs.
  !                                                 It would not give back half of them, of course, but only a
  !                                                 fraction. Several different algorithms for it can be choosen
  !                                                 by chunk_m. They are similar to the algorithm provided by
  !                                                 OpenMP parallel-do (chunk_m = 1 gives a fixed amount of work, respectively
  !                                                 chunksize * m back, chunk_m = 2 does the guided variant with
  !                                                 giving back 1/n_procs of what is still there (as long as it is
  !                                                 more than m), m is the amount of jobs wanted at once
  !                                                 termination here is much easier: if termination_master can not
  !                                                 send any jobs back, it sends termination to the proc. It collects
  !                                                 all the procs he has send a termination to, if he has all and his
  !                                                 own CONTROL has send him a job request he terminates also.

  !           thread are included via wrapper around c pthread routines, The wrappers all start with th and are
  !           located in the thread_wrapper.c file. There are routines for starting and ending threads:
  !            th_create_control, th_create_mail, th_exit, h_join; some for mutexe (blocking of global variables):
  !            th_mutex_lock, th_mutex_unlock; some for conditions (wake and sleep of threads):th_create_mail,
  !            th_cond_signal; and one for setting all the attributes to the threads, mutexes and conditions: th_inits

                                     ! has done, after initalization only used by CONTROL

  logical                           :: i_am_waiting ! Thead 0 (main thread) is waiting for CONTROL

  ! These variables are also essentiel but as they are also needed in dlb_impl_thread_common and to avoid
  ! cyclic dependencies they are stored there:
  !integer(kind=i4_kind), parameter :: LOCK_JS   = 0 !declared in dlb_impl_thread_common

  !logical                           :: terminated ! for termination algorithm

  ! some variables are shared between the three threads, there are also locks and conditions to obtain
  ! following a list, which of the three threads (MAIN, CONTROL, MAILBOX) does read or write on them
  !
  ! "BIG KERNEL LOCK", rwlock for global data (rdlock/wrlock/unlock):
  !
  ! * terminated: this is the flag, telling everybody, that it is done
  !             read: ALL
  !             write: CONTROL, MAILBOX
  ! * reported_by, reported_to:
  !          read: CONTROL, MAILBOX
  !          write: CONTROL, MAILBOX
  !          for termination algorithm, CONTROL and MAILBOX may have knowledge about finished jobs
  !          stored in dlb_common, after other threads have been initalized, will be only accessed
  !          by functions report_to/report_by
  !
  ! Those below are the mutexes that are used in combination with signals:
  !
  ! LOCK_JS:
  ! * job_storage: read: ALL
  !             write: ALL
  !             initialization (before start of the other threads) is without lock!
  !             holds job range of current unfinished jobs, asssigend to this processor
  ! * i_am_waiting: read: CONTROL
  !               write: CONTROL, MAIN
  !               MAIN tells CONTROL, that it is waiting for jobs, thus CONTROL
  !               should better search some and not wait in turn for MAIN to wake it
  ! * already_done: read: CONTROL, MAIN
  !                 write: CONTROL, MAIN
  !                 MAIN stores here how many jobs of the current job interval it has done,
  !                 CONTROL needs and resets this information when reporting jobs for the
  !                 termination algorithm
  !
  ! LOCK_NJ:
  ! * new_jobs:   read: CONTROL          locked by LOCK_NJ
  !             write: CONTROL, MAILBOX
  !             MAILBOX stores here messages, gotten for CONTROL, CONTROL "deletes" them after reading
  ! * count_ask: read: MAILBOX
  !              write: CONTROL
  ! * proc_asked_last: read: MAILBOX
  !                    write: CONTROL, MAILBOX
  !
  ! termination_master, my_rank, n_procs and the paramater: they will be only read, after they have been
  !                initalized in a one thread context
  ! start_jobs: initialized in one thread context, after separation belonging to CONTROL only
  !
  ! the follwing conditions are used to tell:
  ! COND_JS_UPDATE: CONTROL waits here (if there have been enough jobs in the last entry)
  !                 for the other to took some jobs out of job_storage
  ! COND_JS2_UPDATE: if MAIN finds no more jobs in job_storage, it waits here if CONTROL gets
  !                any, CONTROL should not be waiting at that time but busily searching
  !                for more jobs
  !                MAIN tells by i_am_waiting that it has run out of jobs (and got no termination)
  ! COND_NJ_UPDATE: CONTROL waits for answer to a job request, got answer by MAILBOX
  !
  ! For debugging and counting trace
  ! used only on one thread
  integer(kind=i4_kind)             :: count_messages, count_requests, count_offers ! how many messages arrived, MAILBOX
