module dlb_impl
  !---------------------------------------------------------------
  !
  !  Purpose: takes care about dynamical load balancing,
  !           uses an RMA (MPI) object to store the job informations
  !           (only the number of the job) and allows other routines 
  !           to steal them, if they have no own left
  !           unfortunatelly the MPI one-sided works different on different
  !           systems, this routine is only useful if the RMA can be accessed
  !           while the target proc is not in MPI-context
  !
  !           INTERFACE to others:
  !           call dlb_init() - once before first acces
  !           call dlb_setup(init_job) - once every time a dlb should
  !                               be used, init_job should be the part
  !                               of the current proc of an initial job
  !                               distribution
  !           dlb_give_more(n, jobs) :
  !              n should be the number of jobs requested at once, the next
  !              time dlb_give_more is called again, all jobs from jobs should
  !              be finished, jobs are at most n, they are jsut the number of the
  !              jobs, which still have to be transformed between each other,
  !              it should be done the error slice from jobs(0) +1 to jobs(1)
  !              if dlb_give_more returns jobs(0)==jobs(1) there are on no proc
  !              any jobs left
  !
  !          the algorithm: it follows in principle the Algorithm 2 from the
  !                         first reference, each proc has an local RMA memory containing
  !                         job informations, it takes jobs form the left (stp values
  !                         are increased, till stp == ep) then it searches the
  !                         job storages of the other procs for jobs left, this is done
  !                         by a code similar to the one descriebed in the second reference,
  !                         but here on each proc and without specifieng the ranges to work on
  !                         stolen work is put in the own storage, after taking the current job
  !
  !          termination algorithm: called (at least once) "Fixed Energy Distributed Termination
  !                                 Algorithm"
  !                        to avoid confusion, here the term "energy" is not used, talking about
  !                         respoinsibility (resp) instead, every system starts with a part of responsibility
  !                         given to him, if procs steal from him, they have later to send him a
  !                         message saying how many of his jobs, they've done, they always report to
  !                         the proc who had the resp first, thus source is given away with job
  !                         each proc lowers his resp about the values given back from any proc and
  !                         about the jobs he has done himself, when finished them, if he has his resp
  !                         at zero, he sends a message to termination_master
  !                         if termination master has a message from all the procs, that their resp is 0
  !                         he sends a message to all procs, telling them to terminated the algorithm
